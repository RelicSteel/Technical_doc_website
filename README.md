# Technical_doc_website
 
 A website I built to learn how to.

Basic Idea of this website is to learn how to build a website using a different method then normal. I first read of using JavaScript to build the website when I was looking at how incorate JavaScript fully into a website, I came accross Single-Page Application (SPA).

Struggles while coding this website:

CSS and most of the JavaScript. :(
With most of my coding at this point my brain just freezes when I try to do the coding without referances.
Next goal is to redo this site with me looking at the websites I learned the code from less and less.


Things to fix and WIP:

Some width and height size adjustments - mainly in the chatbox section, need to give the chatbox a more responsive sizing.
ROOT - Need to work all my color choose's into this for easier editing in future changes.
Rosponsive - need to make website fully responsive. currently only have order of how content is shown stacked on different screen sizes, also hamburger menu.
